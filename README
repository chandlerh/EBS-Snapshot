I uploaded an example file of how the php class is implemented. This can be added to cron to make backing up the database simple.

### Understanding the Constructor ###
public function __construct($ec2ToolsPath, $cert, $key, $snapDescription, $dbHost, $dbName, $dbUser, $dbPass, $volume, $snapToKeep)

$ec2ToolsPath - This is the path to the tools so that we can run the correct command.

$cert - This is the Amazon cert you get from your Amazon account.

$key - The matching key obtained from your Amazon account.

$snapDescription - The description of your snapshot. It need to be 'something_' . date("Y-m-d"). THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT. If you look at the sorting I explode the array of snapshots by the _ (underscore). And then I use that date to sort them. So make sure you have this or the deleting old snapshots part of the script will not work.

$dbHost - The host of the database. Use the internal ip. Make sure your security groups are open on 22 and 3306 so this can work.

$dbName - Name of the database to connect to.

$dbUser - Database user who has permissions to connect.

$dbPass - Password for $dbUser

$volume - The volume to snapshot

$snapToKeep - The number of snapshots to keep.
